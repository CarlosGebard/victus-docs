# Victus Infra Architecture

## Architectural Overview

`victus-infra` is a repository-owned infrastructure runtime for the Victus
ecosystem.

The system is shaped around a single runtime source of truth:

```text
compose/ -> Docker Compose definitions and service configuration
ansible/ -> host orchestration and deployment of repository-owned files
ops/     -> support tooling for validation, runtime tasks, and migrations
```

Docker Compose defines the service topology. Ansible prepares the VPS,
places runtime files, stages secret-dependent configuration, and starts the
same Compose-defined stacks on the server.

The architecture separates infrastructure by domain so each stack can be
reasoned about and deployed independently.

## Architecture Nodes

Detailed architecture is split into focused modules:

```text
architecture/101-NETWORKING.md        Tailscale, Docker networks, CoreDNS
architecture/102-COMPUTE-RUNTIMES.md  Docker Compose, Ansible, stack runtime
architecture/103-DATA-STORAGE.md      SeaweedFS, Postgres, Redis, volumes
architecture/104-OBSERVABILITY.md     Prometheus, Loki, Langfuse
```

## Major Components

### Core Stack

The `core` stack owns shared infrastructure required by Victus consumers.

```text
compose/projects/core/
```

Primary responsibilities:

- private and public edge routing
- S3-compatible object storage
- durable registry state
- durable event streaming
- private DNS for shared services

Components:

```text
nginx-private    private HTTP edge
nginx-public     public HTTP/TLS edge
seaweedfs        S3-compatible object storage
pipeline-postgres durable pipeline database
redis            durable event stream
etcd             CoreDNS backend state
coredns          private DNS for victus.io
```

Inputs:

- Compose files and environment files from `compose/projects/core/`
- service configs from `compose/configs/`
- runtime secrets staged outside the repository

Outputs:

- private service endpoints for consumer repositories
- public service endpoints for approved public services
- persistent runtime data
- event and registry state used by downstream systems

### Wiki Stack

The `wiki` stack owns public Wiki.js documentation.

```text
compose/projects/wiki/
```

Components:

```text
wiki            Wiki.js application
wiki-database   Wiki.js Postgres database
```

The `wiki` service joins `infra_shared_backend` so `nginx-public` can proxy
the public docs hostname to `wiki:3000`. The database remains on the internal
`wiki_backend` network.

### Observability Stack

The `observability` stack owns runtime visibility.

```text
compose/projects/observability/
```

Components:

```text
prometheus   metrics collection
loki         log storage and querying
```

Inputs:

- Compose files and environment files from `compose/projects/observability/`
- observability configuration from `compose/configs/`

Outputs:

- monitoring and logging surfaces for infrastructure operators
- service health and runtime inspection data

### LLM Stack

The `llm` stack owns LLM gateway key management and LLM observability.

```text
compose/projects/llm/
```

Components:

```text
llm-postgres   durable LiteLLM and Langfuse databases
litellm        OpenAI-compatible LLM gateway and virtual key manager
langfuse       LLM tracing, cost, and audit surface
```

Inputs:

- Compose files and environment files from `compose/projects/llm/`
- LiteLLM config from `compose/configs/litellm/`
- runtime secrets staged outside the repository

Outputs:

- LiteLLM proxy API on port `4000`
- Langfuse UI/API on host port `3001` and container port `3000`
- persisted virtual keys, traces, and audit data

### Deployment Layer

The deployment layer owns host preparation and stack rollout.

```text
ansible/playbooks/
ansible/roles/deploy/
```

Responsibilities:

- prepare expected VPS filesystem structure
- distribute repository-owned Compose and configuration files
- stage runtime configuration that depends on secrets
- execute stack deployment in the expected order

Boundaries:

- Ansible orchestrates deployment; it should not become the source of truth
  for service topology.
- Runtime secrets are injected from external secret management and are not
  committed to the repository.

### Operational Tooling

Operational tooling supports local validation, runtime checks, and shared
database lifecycle tasks.

```text
ops/
tests/
```

Responsibilities:

- validate Compose and Ansible definitions
- support local stack lifecycle
- apply shared database migrations
- perform runtime support tasks that belong to infrastructure

## System Boundaries

### Internal Boundaries

```text
core            shared runtime services and edge routing
observability   monitoring and logging services
llm             LLM gateway, key management, tracing, and cost audit
wiki            public documentation runtime
ansible         host orchestration and deployment
ops             validation and runtime support tooling
docs            repository documentation hubs and nodes
```

Each boundary should remain explicit in paths and documentation.

### External Systems

The architecture depends on external systems for execution and automation:

```text
VPS host          production runtime target
GitHub Actions    deployment automation
Infisical         secret source through OIDC
Docker Engine     container runtime
consumer repos    external systems using shared runtime services
```

### Ownership Limits

This repository owns infrastructure shape and shared runtime contracts.

Consumer repositories own:

- product logic
- app workers
- ingest behavior
- embeddings
- RAG pipelines
- domain-specific processing

## Runtime Flow

### Local Flow

```text
developer
  -> Compose project files
    -> local overrides and env files
      -> local Docker runtime
        -> core and/or observability services
```

Local execution validates the same service topology used for server mode,
with local overrides and local environment values.

### Server Flow

```text
GitHub Actions
  -> Infisical OIDC secrets
    -> Ansible playbooks
      -> VPS filesystem and runtime config
        -> Docker Compose up
          -> deployed stack services
```

Server execution keeps Compose as the runtime definition while Ansible owns
the host-level rollout sequence.

### Consumer Interaction Flow

```text
consumer repository
  -> shared infrastructure endpoint
    -> Postgres for durable registry state
    -> SeaweedFS S3 for artifacts
    -> Redis Streams for durable events
    -> private DNS for service discovery
```

Consumer systems interact with infrastructure through stable endpoints and
shared contracts. Detailed contract guarantees live in
[300-CONTRACTS.md](/repos/victus-infra/docs/300-CONTRACTS).

## Artifact And Data Flow

The runtime supports artifact and state movement for downstream Victus
systems.

```text
source artifact
  -> SeaweedFS S3 object storage
    -> Postgres registry state
      -> Redis Streams event notification
        -> external consumers and workers
```

Storage, registry, and event stream responsibilities are separated:

- SeaweedFS stores objects and derived artifacts.
- Postgres stores durable state and lifecycle status.
- Redis Streams distributes replayable operational events.
- CoreDNS provides stable private names for shared services.

The architecture treats Postgres as the durable state anchor and Redis Streams
as the operational event transport.

## Quality Attributes

### Reproducibility

Runtime topology is defined in checked-in Compose files, which keeps local
and server execution aligned.

### Portability

Environment-specific behavior is expressed through env files, overrides, and
deployment context rather than separate runtime definitions.

### Operability

Stacks are separated by domain, allowing targeted validation, deployment, and
inspection.

### Recoverability

Persistent data is isolated from runtime configuration through explicit host
filesystem areas and service volumes.

### Observability

Monitoring and logging are modeled as a dedicated stack instead of being
embedded into application or core service ownership.

### Low Coupling

Consumer repositories depend on stable infrastructure endpoints and contracts,
not on internal deployment mechanics.
